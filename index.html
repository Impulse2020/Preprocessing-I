        <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>I've been a technophile as long as I can remember at a young age I quickly learned how to set up desktop systems, troubleshoot problems, and implement solutions.
        Of course at the time it just felt like a blast! An early adopter of the net I still remember the pains of dial up, and the magic of "AOL". I spent a lot of time on internet
        forums where I first came in contact with hyperlinks, and BBcode which is similar to HTML. I never lost my passion for exploring the depths of the digital world!
        From Web development to cryptomining, from game dev to video editing, and animation, and even the physical side of telecommunications repair,
         I have always been inspired by tech, and had a tremendous thirst for knowledge!</p>
    <p>
        If you hire me I will bring A natural talent for tech, a drive to succeed, and an positive energy to your work enviroment! Web development is my passion I studied it at
        auburn career center, and even attended a state level competition for Business professionals of america after coming in second at the local competition! I have a great grasp
        of html, css, php, javascript, and python.
